# PEANO Automated Mathematician

This is a project to automatically prove mathematical theorems expressed in the language of second order logic.

It is a follow-on project from the GOFAI project which hard coded a lot of the grammar generation, parse nodes and so on.
This version will be more flexible, slightly simpler in parts, but more capable.

However, this is a work in progress and there is nothing interesting to see just yet!
